        Expense tracking is important in creating a budget for your small
        business. Keeping a daily record of your expenses by tracking receipts,
        invoices, and other outgoing expenses improves the financial health of
        your budget. Tracking expenses can help you stay on top of your cash
        flow and prepare you for tax season.
        <br />
        Expense tracking means recording all your expenditures so you have a
        clear and detailed understanding of your budget. This is typically done
        for a certain project or over a certain period, so you can stay on
        budget and make any necessary adjustments.
        <br />
        For many small businesses, expense tracking may include fixed expenses
        like rent and utilities as well as fluctuating costs like labor, product
        orders, and advertising. Its especially important to record one-time and
        variable costs, as these arent always accounted for in the initial
        budget.
